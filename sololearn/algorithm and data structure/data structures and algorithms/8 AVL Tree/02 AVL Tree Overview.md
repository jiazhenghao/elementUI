Similar to Binary Tree:
    1. Follows all binary tree structural constraints
    2. Search and Enumeration are identical to Binary Tree
    3. Insertion and Deletion differ only in running the Balance algorithm

New Concepts:
    1. Self-Balancing
    2. Height
    3. Balance factor
    4. Right/Left Heavy
