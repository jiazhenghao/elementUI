"But Isaac, javascript already has hash tables! They're called objects, dummy"


Hashing Overview:

Hashing derives a fixed size result from an input
Hashing Algorithm:
    Stable:
        The same input generates the same output everytime
    Uniform:
        The hash value should be uniformly distributed through available space
    Efficient:
        The cost of generating a hash must be balanced with application needs
    Secure:
        The cost of finding data that produces a given hash is prohibitive
