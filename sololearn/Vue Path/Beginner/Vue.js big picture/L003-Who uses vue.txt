Who uses vue?
1.Small teams or individuals creating prototypes or very small apps.
2.Large teams collaborating on building large web applications.
Vue use components to form the front end army. Different developers can create
different components and join together, it's a beautiful application.
3.Seasoned developers brought in to fix a problematic area of a legacy website.
Suppose you have a PHP website, and you want to fix a single page, instead of paying 
a lot of money to ask for php developers to do so, you can use Vue to just replace this
page without destroying the others.
