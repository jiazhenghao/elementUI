1.Simple changes(especially to the view layer) take a long time and 
are so complicated, only senior devs can do them.
2.Requests for new features in the view layer are denied because 
implementing them would be too difficult, or because making the change
might break something else
3.application code is all ad-hoc, new developers have to learn how everything
works from the ground up
