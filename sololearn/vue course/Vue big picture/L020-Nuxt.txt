Server Side Rendered (Universal)
The most popular mode for Nuxt. 
With SSR, also called "universal" or "isomorphic" mode, 
a Node.js server will be used to deliver HTML based on your Vue components
 to the client instead of the pure javascript. 
Using SSR will lead to a large SEO boost, better UX and 
more opportunities (compared to a traditional Vue SPA).

Because implementing SSR on your own can be really tedious, 
Nuxt.js gives you full support out of the box and 
will take care of common pitfalls.

1.Used to create universal(server-rendered) Vue applications.
2.Many universal challenges are simplified by Nuxt
3.Faster loading times on all devices, especially mobile
