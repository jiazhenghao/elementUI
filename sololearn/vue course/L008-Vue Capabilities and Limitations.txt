What vue does:

1. Outputs HTML code for browsers
2. Maps user interactions(e.g, clicking, hovering) to JavaScript methods you write
3. Uses sophisticated techniques to speed the rendering of the application
4. works in most browsers without any build step

What vue does not do:

1.Does not create a server for your application(compliment with Vue-CLI)
2.Does not test code for errors
3.Does not provide significant utility methods //工具方法;Angular
4.Does not facilitate routing(compliment with Vue-Router)
5.Does not provide own solution for modules beyond native ES6//Angular
