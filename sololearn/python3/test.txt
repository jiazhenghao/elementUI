Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. 
Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, 
Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability, 
notably using significant whitespace. 
It provides constructs that enable clear programming on both small and large scales.
[26] Van Rossum led the language community until July 2018.[27][28]
Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. 
It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, 
and functional programming. 
Python features a comprehensive standard library, 
and is referred to as "batteries included".[29]
Python interpreters are available for many operating systems. 
CPython, the reference implementation of Python, is open-source software[30] 
and has a community-based development model. 
Python and CPython are managed by the non-profit Python Software Foundation.
