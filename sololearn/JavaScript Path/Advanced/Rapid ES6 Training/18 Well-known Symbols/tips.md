The data type symbol is a primitive data type. The Symbol() function returns a value of 
type symbol, has static properties that expose several members of built-in objects, has 
static methods that expose the global symbol registry, and resembles a built-in object 
class but is incomplete as a constructor because it does not support the syntax "new 
Symbol()".  

Every symbol value returned from Symbol() is unique.  A symbol value may be used as an 
identifier for object properties; this is the data type's only purpose.  Some further 
explanation about purpose and usage can be found in the glossary entry for Symbol.
