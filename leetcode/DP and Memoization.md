Memoization: 
for a problem with massive duplicate calls, cache the results.
In computing, memoization is an optimization technique used primarily to speed up 
computer programs by storing the results of expensive function calls and returning
the cached result when the same inputs occur again.


Dynamic programming:

requires the subproblem solved in topological order. In many problems, it coincides 
the natural order. For those who doesn't, one need perform topological sorting first. 
Therefore, for those problems with complex topology (like this one), search with 
memorization is usually an easier and better choice.
